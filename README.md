BCG GAMMA, a specialized unit of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) focused on **Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, has unveiled its latest initiative: the BCG GAMMA Challenge. **This annual event is designed to spotlight emerging talents in Data Science and offer them a platform to tackle genuine issues**.


## The Challenge

In its fourth edition, **the challenge invites participants to develop analytical solutions that can drive sustainable economic growth in the Amazon Region, in Brazil**. By harnessing publicly available data from local municipalitiesâ€”ranging from biomes and exports to agricultural production and deforestationâ€”participants are tasked with uncovering vital insights for the area's future.

The challenge centers on promoting sustainable economic development in the municipalities of the Legal Amazon. **Despite the Amazon's vast economic potential, it faces issues such as low social development, underutilized economic opportunities, and increasing deforestation**. Participants are tasked with analyzing data across environmental, social, and economic dimensions using advanced analytics. **The objective is to derive innovative insights and provide actionable recommendations for the ArapyaÃº Institute, an important local non-profit organization,  or public entities to drive sustainable growth in the region.**

## Our Solution

* Note: All the images below were taken from our final presentation.


### Our Solution - Context: *Products compatible with the forest*

**In the Amazon, weâ€‹ have a prevalence of monocultures**. Of the entire area planted within its territory in the year 2019:

* ðŸŒ± **55% soybeans**
* ðŸŒ½ **27% corn**

These monocultures result in soil exhaustion, leading to the nutritional degradation of the land. On the other hand, only a small percentage of cities (about 3% in the region) utilize *products compatible with the forest*, **thereby missing out on the global economic potential of these products**:

### Our Solution - Context: *Social Programs in the Amazon Rainforest*

But **there is no direct mention of products compatible with the forest in these programs**.
