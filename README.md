BCG GAMMA, a specialized unit of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) focused on **Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, has unveiled its latest initiative: the BCG GAMMA Challenge. This annual event is designed to spotlight emerging talents in Data Science and offer them a platform to tackle genuine issues.

In its fourth edition, **the challenge invites participants to develop analytical solutions that can drive sustainable economic growth in the Amazon Region, in Brazil**. By harnessing publicly available data from local municipalities—ranging from biomes and exports to agricultural production and deforestation—participants are tasked with uncovering vital insights for the area's future.
