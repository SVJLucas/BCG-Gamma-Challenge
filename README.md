In its fourth edition, **the challenge invites participants to develop analytical solutions that can drive sustainable economic growth in the Amazon Region, in Brazil**. By harnessing publicly available data from local municipalities—ranging from biomes and exports to agricultural production and deforestation—participants are tasked with uncovering vital insights for the area's future.

The challenge centers on promoting sustainable economic development in the municipalities of the Legal Amazon. **Despite the Amazon's vast economic potential, it faces issues such as low social development, underutilized economic opportunities, and increasing deforestation**. Participants are tasked with analyzing data across environmental, social, and economic dimensions using advanced analytics. **The objective is to derive innovative insights and provide actionable recommendations for the Arapyaú Institute, an important local non-profit organization,  or public entities to drive sustainable growth in the region.**
