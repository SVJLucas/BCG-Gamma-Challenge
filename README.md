BCG GAMMA, a specialized unit of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) focused on **Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, has unveiled its latest initiative: the BCG GAMMA Challenge. **This annual event is designed to spotlight emerging talents in Data Science and offer them a platform to tackle genuine issues**.


## The Challenge

In its fourth edition, **the challenge invites participants to develop analytical solutions that can drive sustainable economic growth in the Amazon Region, in Brazil**. By harnessing publicly available data from local municipalities—ranging from biomes and exports to agricultural production and deforestation—participants are tasked with uncovering vital insights for the area's future.

The challenge centers on promoting sustainable economic development in the municipalities of the Legal Amazon. **Despite the Amazon's vast economic potential, it faces issues such as low social development, underutilized economic opportunities, and increasing deforestation**. Participants are tasked with analyzing data across environmental, social, and economic dimensions using advanced analytics. **The objective is to derive innovative insights and provide actionable recommendations for the Arapyaú Institute, an important local non-profit organization,  or public entities to drive sustainable growth in the region.**

## Our Solution

### Our Solution - Context: *Products compatible with the forest*

**In the Amazon, we​ have a prevalence of monocultures**. Of the entire area planted within its territory in the year 2019:

</p>

Few cities use *products compatible with the forest* (only about 3% of total cities in the region), **losing the economic potential of these products globally**.

### Our Solution - Context: *Social Programs in the Amazon Rainforest*

But **there is no direct mention of products compatible with the forest in these programs**.
